In this repository I am developing Introduction to Computational Physics course with lectures notes written in interactive Jupyter notebooks.
## Intro to Computational Physics
An introductory course to proagramming in python and jupyter notebooks for people with concentrations in physics, engineering, and related fields. This course contains two parts:
1. Basics: 
    * Data types, arrays 
    * For and while loops, conditional statements 
    * Data handling and visualization, plotting, regression 
    * Visualization in higher dimensions (e.g., principle component analysis)
2. Advanced (numerical methods and simulations):
   * Root finding 
   * Fourier Transform 
   * Monte carlo simulations of Ising model 
Exercices and numerical methods involve problems related to mechanics, soft and hard condensed matter physics, and finances.  

## Overview 
This course directory structure is as follows:
* ```fourier-analysis/```:
* ```ising-model/```: 
* ```lecturenotes/```: All lecture notes (jupyter notebook) in pdf format.
