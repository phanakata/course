In this repository I am developing Introduction to Computational Physics course with lectures notes written in interactive Jupyter notebooks.
## Intro to Computational Physics
An introductory course to proagramming in python and jupyter notebooks for people with concentrations in physics, engineering, and related fields. This course contains two parts:
1. Basic computings: 
    * Data types, arrays 
    * For loop, while, if statements 
    * Plotting
2. Numerical methods:

## Overview 
This course directory structure is as follows:
* ```fourier-analysis/```:
* ```ising-model/```: 
* ```lecturenotes/```: All lecture notes (jupyter notebook) in pdf format.
