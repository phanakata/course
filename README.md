In this repository I am developing Introduction to Computational Physics course with lectures notes written in interactive Jupyter notebooks.
## Intro to Computational Physics
An introductory course to proagramming in python and jupyter notebooks for people with concentrations in physics, engineering, and related fields. 

### Learning goals:
1. Familiarity with programming in python, Jupyter notebook and scientific packages for scientific computing 
2. Understanding the mathematics of numerical methods and approximation 
3. Familiarity with implementing numerical methods in python and applying them to real physical problems 

This course contains two parts:
1. Basics: 
    * Data types, arrays 
    * For and while loops, conditional statements 
    * Data handling and visualization, plotting, regression 
    * Visualization in higher dimensions (e.g., principle component analysis)
2. Advanced (numerical methods and simulations):
   * Root finding 
   * Fourier Transform 
   * Monte Carlo simulations of Ising model 
Exercices and numerical methods involve problems related to mechanics, soft and hard condensed matter physics, and finances.  

### Course evaluations:
1. Bi-weekly assigments: mathematical derivations, programming exercises, and code developments.  
2. Group projects 
3. Group presentation 

### Overview of directories  
This course directory structure is as follows:
* ```fourier-transform/```:
* ```ising-model/```: 
* ```lecturenotes/```: All lecture notes (jupyter notebook) in pdf format.
